In a relaxed innovation-driven, technology-based environment founded by Sir Alec Reed (founder of Reed) I managed and enhanced an online donation platform for over 8,000 charities. The system processes millions of pounds every year. I worked with both legacy code and a new MVC framework to produce quality, cross-browser compatible pages fast – all the while paying attention to ensuring good user interfaces and coding practices. I also managed a parallel Wordpress system and helped colleagues with computer queries and database export requests. Furthermore, I liaised with payment processors, worked on 3D Secure pages (‘Verified by Visa’) and ensured the consistency of our databases with that of payment processors. In addition I also trained my replacement.

Notable achievements include:
 - Saving thousands of pounds for the company by bringing design work in-house.
 - Selling out 270 event tickets in 14 minutes - this was for a charity event at Fortnum & Mason. The system I made worked flawlessly in its first public run.

## Projects

### Decentralised Coordination of UAVs
Sep 2013 - May 2014 · 
University of Southampton

Technologies used: Python, Java, JavaScript, Git, JQuery, backbone.js, underscore.js

Created a system of Intelligent Agents that worked together to control UAVs in disaster response scenarios. The back-end used the Max-Sum Algorithm for the decentralised coordination of said UAVs while the front-end was a web interface.

Being meant for non-technical users (first responders and emergency services) it had a strong focus on good interface design and was part of on-going research by ORCHID into Human-Agent Collectives. It also helped to better understand how humans and automated systems can most effectively work together. User testing of a sample of university students was conducted as part of the project, and the accumulated user interaction data was incorporated to improve the UI.

My supervisors were Professor Nick Jennings and Dr Luke Teacy who have helped me greatly in the project. Further recognition goes to Dr Feng Wu whose code I inherited and has always been available to provide a helping hand.Technologies used: Python, Java, JavaScript, Git, JQuery, backbone.js, underscore.js Created a system of Intelligent Agents that worked together to control UAVs in disaster response scenarios.

### Laser Pong
Feb 2014 · 
University of Southampton

Essentially a game of Pong made using powerful lasers. As part of a 48 hour international competition, I and two friends worked on Atmel's SAM4L development board, Zigbits and lasers mounted on servos to recreate the classic game of pong, but where lasers beams were used for the ball and paddles. This enjoyable project led us to win the People's Choice Award from EMECS (http://emecs-thon.org/).
