### Decentralised Coordination of UAVs
Sep 2013 - May 2014 ¬∑ University of Southampton

Technologies used: Python, Java, JavaScript, Git, JQuery, backbone.js, underscore.js

Created a system of Intelligent Agents that worked together to control UAVs in disaster response scenarios. The back-end used the Max-Sum Algorithm for the decentralised coordination of said UAVs while the front-end was a web interface.

Being meant for non-technical users (first responders and emergency services) it had a strong focus on good interface design and was part of on-going research by ORCHID into Human-Agent Collectives. It also helped to better understand how humans and automated systems can most effectively work together. User testing of a sample of university students was conducted as part of the project, and the accumulated user interaction data was incorporated to improve the UI.

### Laser Pong
Feb 2014 ¬∑ University of Southampton

Essentially a game of Pong made using powerful lasers. As part of a 48 hour international competition, I and two friends worked on Atmel's SAM4L development board, Zigbits and lasers mounted on servos to recreate the classic game of pong, but where lasers beams were used for the ball and paddles. This enjoyable project led us to win the People's Choice Award from EMECS (http://emecs-thon.org/).
